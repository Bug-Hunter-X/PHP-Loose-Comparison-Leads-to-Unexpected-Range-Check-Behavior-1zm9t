This code suffers from a subtle issue related to how PHP handles type juggling and comparisons.  The function `checkValue` intends to check if a given value is within a specific range (1000 to 2000), but due to the loose comparison (`==`), it produces unexpected results with strings. If a string like "1000" is passed, it will evaluate to true because PHP converts the string to an integer for the comparison. This could lead to incorrect results if you expect strict type checking.
